# Siwt

Sign In With Tezos (SIWT) is a library that supports the development of your decentralized application (dApp) by:

- proving the users ownership of the private key to the address the user signs in with,
- adding permissions to use your API or Backend using on chain data.

## Packages

SIWT is split up in several packages:

### [Core](https://github.com/StakeNow/SIWT/tree/develop/packages/core)
This package handles the JWT tokens. Use this on the servers side to create and verify tokens. This package should only be used server side [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@siwt/core)

### [Access Control Query (acq)](https://github.com/StakeNow/SIWT/tree/develop/packages/acq)
Use this package to define the requirements your user needs to obtain access. Currently it supports:
- checking if your user has a certain NFT
- checking if a user is (or is not) on a provided whitelist
- checking if a user has a min/max amount of XTZ
- checking if a user has a min/max amount of a fungible token
