# SIWT

Sign In With Tezos (SIWT) is a library that supports the development of your decentralized application (dApp) by:

- proving the users ownership of the private key to the address the user signs in with,
- adding permissions to use your API or backend using on chain data.

After winning the [Tezos x Encode hackathon](https://medium.com/encode-club/encode-x-tezos-hackathon-finale-prizewinners-and-summary-ba5c9cda677c) and due to the positive feedback from the Tezos community, we decided to spend additional efforts to take our Proof-of-Concept to an easy-to-integrate library with an extended feature set with the help of the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/). We invite you to use SIWT in your dApp and contact us in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6J3bjhkpxm?utm_source=StakeNow+Discord&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_campaign=StakeNow.Fi+Launch) if you have any questions! You can read about the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/StakeNow/.github/blob/main/README.md).
